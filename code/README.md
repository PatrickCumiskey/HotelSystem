- Set up a python virtual environment (install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper) in an external directory
- activate the environment


- Install dependencies
  ~~~BASH
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ~~~


- Install mysql
  - Maybe it would be easier if we all use the same db info
    - username: root
    - password: password
    - dbname: db_hotel (for now)


- Run the project:
  ~~~BASH
  python server.py
  ~~~
