# Learn Git!!!!
## >>https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
- Don't push IDE files and complied files :)

## GitLab
- **Submit pull requests** (rather than pushing directly)
  - Design issues/tweaks (rather than refactors later)
    - **Ensure we stick to OOP and don't do any crazy stuff Python lets us**
  - Learning for other team members
    - i.e. Python
- Create issues
  - Issues board integrated (Agile)
  - Backlog for ideas without forgetting
  - Prioritisation
  - Establish clear tasks
- Wiki with MarkDown support rather than word documents

Put **everything** on the repo.
Every action item should have a tracking item on the issues board
**(easier for everybody as we can discuss the issue in the issues section)**

## Project
- Only suggestions, discuss
  - Consider Python and Flask as a web framework
      - MVC friendly
  - PIP for dependency management (comes with Python)
    - Easier as dependencies will be brought in automatically for all team members
  - Consider stubs for key components in design and code e.g. GUI


## Documentation
- Use markdown 'as we go'
  - Use to create word document later
    - Nobody will maintain this ;)
  - Git/VS friendly
  - **Add all documentation images in the images folder**
  ~~~Markdown
  // Like this

  - **[MarkDown guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)**
- Use a UML software so we can make changes later

## Communication
- Slack seems good (Facebook is crap)
  - Easy to manage
    - Integration (GitLab) and better file management
