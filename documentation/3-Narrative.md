# 3. Narrative

## Overview
The hospitality business has changed significantly in the last number of years.
People are travelling more, for work or leisure, and expect an ever increasing standard of efficentcy.

Unfortunately, many existing systems for hotel management have failed to keep up and modernise.
Often hotels are using outdated systems with limited features. This is because migration is difficult and licensing is expensive.

## Hotel Management System
Our Hotel Management System will provide an end-to-end solution for efficient hotel management.

We provide management with administrative options such as pricing and staff management, as well as options to generate sales and forecast reports to help make business decisions.

Staff are delighted with our modern approach to managing rooms, room service and bookings.

Customers can make bookings on-line for any hotel in a clients chain. Their information will be saved for later bookings providing a quick and easy to use service to ensure customers return. Once the customer arrives they can optionally use the self service check in. Kiosks provide the user with their key card and allow them to later check out and make their payment. This also means that customers can check in after hours.

Because we manage your infastructure via the cloud, you won't experince any downtime should your POS system fails. Clients are always running the latest version with cutting edge features and security.
Our web based system means any device can be used rather than expensive, old fashioned POS systems.

We provide a REST API to allow integration with existing systems.

The system requires users to have sufficient privileges and authentication to complete certain actions.

The system will also scale for large chains of hotels.
